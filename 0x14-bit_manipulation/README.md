# Bit Manipulation Project

This project includes several functions to perform various operations on numbers in binary, such as converting to decimal, displaying in binary, modifying bits, and counting bits to toggle.

## Functions

0. **binary_to_uint** - Converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.

1. **print_binary** - Prints the binary representation of a number.

2. **get_bit** - Gets the value of a bit at a given index.

3. **set_bit** - Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. **clear_bit** - Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. **flip_bits** - Counts the number of bits to flip from one number to another.
